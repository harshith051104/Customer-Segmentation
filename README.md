# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers into different segments based on their annual income and spending score.

## About The Project

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to perform the following steps:
1.  Generate a synthetic dataset of customers with 'annual_income' and 'spending_score' features.
2.  Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for the K-Means algorithm.
3.  Apply K-Means clustering to segment the customers into `k` clusters.
4.  Evaluate the clustering performance using the Silhouette Score.
5.  Visualize the customer segments and cluster centroids.
